Are you looking for a cool project?
Do you need an activity to put in your portfolio?
Are you bored and wanna have some fun?

We'll, I've got you covered!
Meet: Pwnagotchi
Don't pay for internet, ever again lol :joy::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

Pwnagotchi is like Pokemon and Tomogachi combined into one, but for us Hackers!
As you've already may have noticed, I have been advocating for ya'll to get a Raspberry Pi for most of your hacking projects/portfolio. With the cost of only $15 who can blame me?
This super compact mini "computer"  has the power to do most of your hacking projects. It also has the form factor for James Bond Q spy hacking action! Just tuck it in a hidden corner and done!

This project has a price any student can afford. The price, oh baby! The price! https://youtube.com/shorts/YZLc4-DYwB8?si=9kK5vVsiTck2-OWp
Then is the SD system. You can store different projects in each SD and just swap SD's instead of your wallet.

Anyway, enough shameless promotion. Now onto the details of the Pwnagotchi
This is a Wi-Fi hacking tool What sets this project apart from the Wi-Fi Pineapple, in my opinion are two things:
Fun factor
AI

Perhaps you do not care much about the fun factor, to walk around town. Or wardriving to feed your Pwnagotchi and keep it happy. But you will surely care about the AI function.
You see, both points 1 and 2 are connected because the more you "feed" your Pwnagotchi friend with Wi-Fi locations, to keep it happy, the better it gets at hacking through AI learning.
That is right, this little project is powered by AI and can get really good at cracking some password protected Wi-FI signals. Gotta-catch-em-all!

So how do you make one?
