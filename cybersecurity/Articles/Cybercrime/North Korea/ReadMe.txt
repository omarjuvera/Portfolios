In the case of North Korea, the government is a dictatorship, just like China and Russia.
You do what they say or your it. When it comes to North Korea, because of the sanctions they hyper-focus on making weapons or weaponizing the internet to bring in revenue.

This is why they have a good hacker presence world wide. Cannot confirm nor deny if they are "the best" but sure North Korea enslave tons and tons of their people to hack.
In my oppinion, it is also about the numbers! At this point it becomes their "legal" government job for these unfortunate NK citizens.
