<p><strong>IT Black Friday Specials, 2023</strong></p>

<p>Today is Black Friday and as fellow techies, I would HIGLY recommend to take advantage of these special</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/collections/black-friday-cybersecurity-courses" target="_blank">Coursera Premium</a><br />
	This offer is $1 dollar. ONE dollar, for the first month.<br />
	Just pay the $1 and finish as many courses as you can within that one month. Cancel before you have to pay $60<br />
	&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>If you do get this offer, I want to recommend: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity?irgwc=1&amp;utm_medium=partners&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_campaign=4218911&amp;utm_content=b2c" target="_blank">Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</a><br />
		<strong>This certification course comes HIGHLY recommended</strong>. Just about everyone is saying this course is better than CompTIA Security+ Certification. Check out the reviews on YouTube<br />
		You can TOTALLY finish it for $1 (in less than 4 weeks)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a><br />
	This one is one of my favorite Black Friday sales of the year. Most courses are under $20 (usually $10). And they NEVER expire. You have these courses for the life of your account!<br />
	<br />
	On top of that, <strong>the courses are updated constantly every year</strong>. You&#39;re not buying a 2023 course and will be outdated in two years. All courses are updated every year, sometimes more often than that.</li>
</ul>

<p>My top <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> picks are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/" target="_blank">Zero To Mastery (ZMT)</a>:

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-ethical-hacking-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery/" target="_blank">Complete Ethical Hacking Bootcamp 2023: Zero to Mastery</a><br />
		On top of being straight to the point and focusing to teach you ONLY what you REALLY need, in the most EZ way possible, they have a full Discord server to support their students.<br />
		<br />
		PLUS LinkedIn / Indeed completion badges. GREAT to show off your education and training. I really recommend their courses.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/" target="_blank">Dr. Angela Yu</a>:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/" target="_blank">100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023</a><br />
		She comes highly recommended by many people in the IT industry as a good teacher with plenty of knowledge. NetworkChuck is one of them who recommends her.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Cloud Courses:
	<ul>
		<li>AWS Cloud Practitioner from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-master-aws-fundamentals/" target="_blank">ZMT</a> or from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/" target="_blank">Stephane Maarek</a> (best seller)</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/" target="_blank">Docker from Bret Fisher</a>. Bret is REALLY good at explaining and teaching IMO</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
And finally, <a href="https://www.itpro.tv/courses/certification/" target="_blank">ITProTV</a>.<br />
Although I can&#39;t find this year&#39;s discount it is usually around 30% off.<br />
What&#39;s great about ITProTV is that the format is similar to TestOut, which you are already familiar with from this class.<br />
Yes, it is a bit pricy, but it is a year subscription. So it may sendup being cheaper than the first two (Coursera and Udemy) in the end.<br />
Just take the course, get certified and presto!</p>

<p>Got a course you like or would like to recommend? Let me know in the comments<br />
I&#39;d love to read them</p>
