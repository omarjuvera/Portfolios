<p><strong>NetBoot.xyz</strong></p>

<p>During my weekly extracurricular research, I stubbled upon <a href="https://netboot.xyz/" target="_blank">NetBoot.xyz</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4btW5x_clpg" target="_blank">accompanying video</a>. With <a href="https://netboot.xyz/">NetBoot.xyz</a> you can try MANY OS in your computer without having to install it (in most cases). Why is this something I am recommending? We&#39;ll, no need for VM&#39;s!</p>

<p>Also as the video suggested, you can do away without USB&#39;s to have a fresh install of any OS you choose.</p>

<p>Just reboot in NIC Boot Mode with PXE enabled and done!<br />
You have lots of OS to test drive. EZ! Just be careful not to wipe your hard drive accidentally. That is the only caution I&#39;d give. Other than that, you can try as many OS NetBoot.xyz has to offer in minutes.</p>

<p>SUPER convenient!</p>
