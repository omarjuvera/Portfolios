Wi-Fi Antennas

Within the antennas types there are two main categories: Omnidirectional and Directional

Omnidirectional Antennas
Homes and most small business uses Omnidirectional antennas.
This type is the most common and at the same time the most unsecured since the LAN device broadcasts the signal "everywhere" and it is only stopped by physical obstacles like walls.
This allows hackers to be near a site without even being next to the building.

Directional Antennas
Directional antennas, as the name entails, sends signal in a single direction.
As chapter 13 explains, enterprises uses these antennas to connect their wireless connections between buildings.
Because the antennas only broadcast the signal in a single direction, these antennas are harder to hack but not impossible.

Gain
Gain measures how STRONG the signal is.
So, if you hear someone saying: "This antenna is a high gain antenna" what they are saying is that the antenna emits a strong signal and therefore has a LONG range
Since gain only measures the strength of the antenna (and therefore range), this applies to BOTH, Omnidirectional and Directional antennas

Yagi & Parabolic
Within directional antennas, as chapter 13 showed, Yagi is the highest gain antenna. Followed by Parabolic antennas.
Therefore, if your company needs a long range antenna, Yagi is your choice. If the same company also has a budget constraint, then Parabolic would be the choice
