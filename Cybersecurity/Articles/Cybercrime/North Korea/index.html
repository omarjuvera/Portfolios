        <h1>Unveiling the Dark Side: How Nation-State Actors Drive Cybercrime Revenue in North Korea</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Did you know that Cybercrime ranks among the top 5 revenue sources for North Korea? As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/18/how-does-north-korea-get-money-to-build-nuclear-weapons.html">CNBC in 2017</a>, the government's hyper-focus on weapon development, exacerbated by economic sanctions, has led them to leverage the cyber realm to generate income.

            <h2>The Dictatorial Landscape</h2>
            <p>
                Much like China and Russia, North Korea operates under a dictatorship where compliance is non-negotiable. The consequences of non-compliance can be severe. Economic sanctions have forced North Korea to intensify its efforts in weapon development and cyber operations as alternative revenue streams.

            <h2>The Global Hacker Presence</h2>
            <p>
                North Korea boasts a significant hacker presence worldwide. While it's hard to confirm whether they are the absolute best, what is clear is that North Korea employs a vast number of citizens to engage in hacking activities. This has become a de facto "legal" government job for many unfortunate North Korean citizens.
